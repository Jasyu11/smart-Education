Stage 2. Prototype Implementation

Our application is made out of two components, the backend, which is stored in the xxx folder, and the frontend, which is stored in the xxx folder.
In order to run the frontend, you can go inside the xxx folder and install all the dependencies by first using 
1.    npm install 

For the backend, you can go inside the xxx folder using the command 

2.   ./mvnw spring-boot:run   
     
Finally, you can start the project by using ‘npm start’ in the frontend, and a sign-in page will open for you to enter the system.
In this stage, our group will implement our Smart Education Metaverse System, which is used to offer remote education for both teachers and students in the situation of a pandemic. In this system, people can learn and teach everywhere and at every time. Besides, users can have their own virtual avatar created from the picture they upload, which gives them more fun when using this system.

The highlight of our project:
1.      Implement the majority of functions that we designed in stage 1:
2.      Learning material system 
3.      Teachers upload learning material
4.     Assignment/Exam system
5.     Create assignment/exam
6.     Create avatar
7.     Discussion board
8.     Enrolment system
9.     Virtual payment

Metaverse features design: Users can create virtual avatars through the photo they upload from the profile page.

Advanced technologies:
